In the upper left corner is written CH<sub>4</sub>, the chemical formula for natural gas, and in the bottom right is everybody&#8217;s favorite molecule, CO<sub>2</sub>. In between these extremes&#8212;sloping downward and to the right&#8212;are the words oil, coal, and wood, in that order. What our chalkboard illustrates is a gross approximation of the extent to which the carbon atoms embodied in those materials are already burned (i.e., oxidized), and by extension how much residual energy can be extracted from these feedstocks by burning them further. In essence, it serves as a proxy for energy density.</p><p>Since CH<sub>4</sub> has no oxygen atoms and every carbon is surrounded by four hydrogens, it is not burned at all and is rich in potential energy. Oil has fewer hydrogens per carbon atom and barely any oxygen, so it is only slightly more burned than CH<sub>4</sub>. Coal contains less hydrogen still and a fair bit of oxygen, so it is measurably more burned than oil. Wood is replete with oxygen-rich celluloses and other complex natural polymers, putting it below coal on our chalkboard. Finally, CO<sub>2</sub> is saturated with oxygen, and so the carbon in it is fully burned. It is a thermodynamic sink.</p><p>It follows from this rudimentary chemistry lesson that burning wood emits more CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of energy produced than burning coal, that coal is worse than oil, and that oil is worse than natural gas. The same can be said about other undesirable byproducts of combustion, as wood and coal in particular contain all manner of contaminants that do not burn very well. As an instructive contrast, natural gas burns so cleanly and efficiently that we use it for cooking indoors with nary a thought given to ventilation, but starting a campfire in the middle of your living room would be, well, kind of nuts. The clouds of smoke that blanketed much of North America last year as a result of forest fires in Canada are testimony to these obvious empirical truths.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png" width="1065" height="799" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:799,&quot;width&quot;:1065,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:213298,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0885e523-21f8-4179-8441-09b4817d782f_1065x799.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Smoking problem | Getty</figcaption></figure></div><p>It has come to our attention that some people are concerned about how much CO<sub>2</sub> humans emit into the atmosphere. These people &#8211; who seem to work mainly for governments, at non-profits, and on university campuses &#8211; would prefer to restrict activities that increase carbon emissions, since failing to do so will apparently lead to a parade of unrecoverable catastrophes. They seem quite settled in this view, and it is logical to assume that, given the choice, they would advocate moving up and to the left on our chalkboard. Such logic makes what has occurred in the UK and other countries across Europe rather curious. We turn to a <a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2018/06/19/uk-s-move-away-coal-means-they-re-burning-us-wood">story</a> from 2018 for some early details (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The 12 cooling towers at the Drax Power Station have dominated the flat North Yorkshire countryside since the plant was built to burn coal from local mines in the &#8217;60s. It&#8217;s the largest power plant in the UK, and for years it served as a visible reminder of how essential coal has been for the country. <strong>But five years ago, Drax started switching from burning coal to burning wood.</strong>&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><p>In the intervening years, four of Drax&#8217;s six generators at its Selby facility have been converted to burn wood, while the two remaining coal-fired generators have been removed from service. The station <a href="https://www.aquaswitch.co.uk/blog/drax-biomass-power-station/">currently</a> produces about 4% of the UK&#8217;s electricity and sources much of its wood from abroad, especially Canada and the US. The rationale for this exercise is downright perplexing:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Drax started transitioning its units off of coal and onto wood fuel because the UK government is putting tight restrictions on carbon emissions to help fight climate change. This year, the country announced its plan to cease burning coal for electricity entirely by 2025. <strong>And under EU [and UK] law, biomass is classified as a source of carbon neutral energy.</strong></em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2290491,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8bb9a1f-7e5e-4850-ba31-c0c3323839c0_2121x1414.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Presto, it&#8217;s green! | John Lamb/Getty</figcaption></figure></div><p>By government decree, burning wood no longer produces more CO<sub>2</sub> than burning coal.

Nobody makes money in China, they figure, so there&#8217;s probably not much to worry about&#8212;although, some of the designs do look suspiciously close to technology that had been firmly shielded by patents and as trade secrets&#8230;or so they thought.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg" width="1200" height="800" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:157995,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b191ec3-9d3a-4a34-a75c-dff2a63e9668_1200x800.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Show and steal | Axton Global</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lured by the prospect of filling factories and beating Wall Street expectations, more Western suppliers get in on the action, competing to win orders in the world&#8217;s ultimate growth market. As a condition of securing Chinese business, joint ventures with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are set up, technology is shared, and factories are built locally. Within months, virtually all industry leaders conform to the rules of the game. Wall Street demands growth above all else, and the fear of missing out is strong.</p><p>Suddenly, yet another unheard-of company is launched out of China, but this one is shockingly different. This SOE combines the best of the incumbent technology, and its products are demonstrably superior to what the West can offer. This phenom company begins rolling up market share in China, forcing international competitors to scramble. Then the exports begin. The value proposition on offer is hard to believe: the products are excellent, the price is a fraction of what was previously thought to be impossibly cheap, and supply appears to be practically infinite. Unable to compete and with precious little domestic support, waves of Western companies go out of business. In a flash, the CCP now monopolizes the industry.</p><p>No matter how many times the same pattern plays out, the West always seems blind to the game China is playing, with one recent exception: semiconductors. China is making the development of a domestic semiconductor supply chain a matter of urgent national importance. The US and its allies are running in the same race while doing everything in their power to prevent China from succeeding. Much ink has been spilled on the geopolitical tensions rising from these efforts.</p><p>The US might be &#8220;early to worry&#8221; in this instance, but will they succeed in preventing China from becoming the global leader in this technology? Count us among the doubtful. Let&#8217;s explore why.</p>

Hydro-Qu&#233;bec&#8212;the government-owned utility that manages the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity across the Province of Qu&#233;bec&#8212;set about damming much of La Grande Rivi&#232;re watershed in the name of electricity production. We turn to <em>The Canadian Encyclopedia</em> for the <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/james-bay-project">staggering details</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The [James Bay] project flooded 11,500 km<sup>2</sup> of wilderness land that was home to the James Bay Cree and Inuit. The village of Fort George (population 2,373), at the mouth of La Grande Rivi&#232;re, was uprooted and relocated upstream. It is now called Chisasibi. The village of Eastmain now lies in a saltwater estuary, as Rivi&#232;re Eastmain was reduced to a trickle. The flooding also created mercury contamination in fish, as mercury was released from rotting vegetation in the reservoirs, and contributed to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 caribou. Vast areas of wilderness were inundated (flooded) and forests were incinerated (burned) in an attempt to clear debris.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg" width="1024" height="480" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:116978,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6300d81-a834-4a15-ad5c-bacf2f09e790_1024x480.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Distinctly more than 240 acres | Hydro-Qu&#233;bec</figcaption></figure></div><p>According to the <a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com/generation/">company</a>, &#8220;<em>Hydro-Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s generating fleet comprises 61 hydroelectric generating stations and 24 thermal plants with a total installed capacity of 37.2 GW.

Germany&#8217;s rejection of nuclear power and the region&#8217;s obsession with renewable sources of electricity were causing strain, but at least Europe could count on a seemingly endless flow of cheap natural gas from Russia via pipeline. Heavy industry largely depended on access to this critical resource, which served as one of the few pillars of manufacturing competitiveness on the Old Continent.</p><p>The well-documented catastrophe that has since befallen Europe&#8217;s economic, political, and security prospects need not be rearticulated here, but suffice it to say, the past two years have been rather challenging. Reeling from a contracting economy, depleted weaponry, and an all-too-predictable populist backlash, the region has entered a period of deep uncertainty. The future of the European Union (EU) might itself be at risk, a shift that would have seemed unfathomable just a short time ago.</p><p>A remarkable article, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/talks-could-have-ended-war-ukraine">published</a> last week in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>&#8212;a magazine issued by the hotbed of US political establishment thinking known as the Council on Foreign Relations&#8212;reveals a story that would have certainly been censored as disinformation at the start of the war: It was all largely preventable. In what reads as part confessional and part opening salvo for future negotiations, the expansive report begins with a lucid summation of what could have been:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>What happened on the battlefield is relatively well understood. What is less understood is the simultaneous intense diplomacy involving Moscow, Kyiv, and a host of other actors, which could have resulted in a settlement just weeks after the war began.</em></p><p><em>By the end of March 2022, a series of in-person meetings in Belarus and Turkey and virtual engagements over video conference had produced the so-called Istanbul Communiqu&#233;, which described a framework for a settlement. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators then began working on the text of a treaty, making substantial progress toward an agreement. But in May, the talks broke off. The war raged on and has since cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png" width="1456" height="970" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2331234,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0fa4ed4a-4321-48b3-a27b-0113a65b9b18_1600x1066.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Aborted diplomacy | Reuters</figcaption></figure></div><p>The piece goes on to echo the substance of what President Putin told Tucker Carlson in that infamous interview a few weeks ago, differing only in minor details and in degree of emphasis. A negotiated settlement had largely been agreed to, only to be scuttled in part because of Western indifference to the outcome:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>So why did the talks break off? Putin has claimed that Western powers intervened and spiked the deal because they were more interested in weakening Russia than in ending the war. He alleged that Boris Johnson, who was then the British prime minister, had delivered the message to the Ukrainians, on behalf of &#8216;the Anglo-Saxon world,&#8217; that they must &#8216;fight Russia until victory is achieved and Russia suffers a strategic defeat.&#8217;</em></p><p><em>The Western response to these negotiations, while a far cry from Putin&#8217;s caricature, was certainly lukewarm. Washington and its allies were deeply skeptical about the prospects for the diplomatic track emerging from Istanbul&#8230;</em></p><p><em>So instead of embracing the Istanbul communiqu&#233; and the subsequent diplomatic process, the West ramped up military aid to Kyiv and increased the pressure on Russia, including through an ever-tightening sanctions regime.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg" width="1110" height="741" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:741,&quot;width&quot;:1110,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:417018,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48b41393-c814-42d5-b107-578a5edfd14a_1110x741.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">How about no? | Getty</figcaption></figure></div><p>If the original <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_137930.htm">intent</a> of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was to &#8220;<em>keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down,</em>&#8221; it would seem the war in Ukraine is accomplishing at least one of those objectives.

Driven by the proliferation of bias-confirming social media, people are herded into corners of the internet where views they agree with are amplified and dissent is swiftly marginalized, shouted down, or canceled altogether.</p><p>Science, at least for now, is still practiced by humans, and thus the field is not immune from these forces. Groupthink, social pressures, adherence to authority, and the ever-pressing need to please those who decide what work gets funded can make the proper functioning of science&#8212;and the vital role of hypothesis nullification&#8212;quite difficult. The civilized exchange of conflicting views lies at the very heart of the scientific method, and even the most bedrock of theories is perpetually one well-designed experiment away from collapse.</p><p>The phrase &#8220;settled science&#8221; is, therefore, oxymoronic. No such thing exists. One might find evidence in support of a particular hypothesis convincing, or a particular theory so well-established that few scientists are interested in doing further work on the matter, but in the scientific pursuit, one can&#8217;t ever say something is settled. Once that word is uttered&#8212;or worse yet, shouted&#8212;you depart from science and swerve into something more akin to religion.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1485428,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c7f443-d954-4443-87e5-2aa539b389ee_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Who wants to tell them? | Sky News</figcaption></figure></div><p>Take the connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. The evidence in support of the notion that smoking causes cancer is extremely compelling, so much so that practically nobody doubts a strong causal relationship. But even here, the use of the word settled would be highly inappropriate. Scientists don&#8217;t currently agree on a universal definition of cancer, whether lung cancer is an inherently different disease than breast cancer, what the best treatment strategies are for the various ways in which cancer manifests, and whether cancer can ever truly be cured. In other words, little is known about the fundamental aspects of cancer.</p><p>For illustrative purposes, consider the following counter-conjecture to the current scientific consensus on the matter:</p><p>&#8220;<em>The placebo effect is real and difficult to explain. Patients routinely experience improved treatment outcomes based on nothing more than the belief that they are receiving treatment, even though they aren&#8217;t. If people can talk themselves out of a disease, perhaps they could talk themselves into one.

After all, the decarbonization solution is no picnic, threatening the citizens of the Western world with degradation to their standards of living and condemning billions of others in developing nations to a permanent state of poverty.</p><p>A hushed secret of the scientific community is that many of the world&#8217;s top scientists have serious and legitimate questions about the entire construct. They believe much of the experimental and modeling work in the field to be shabby at best and find the efforts to censor alternative views abhorrent and anti-scientific. We&#8217;ve certainly heard such hushed musings countless times over the decades, although we suspect few who expressed them could have imagined the scale to which the carbon affair has subsequently bloomed. &nbsp;</p><p>In recent weeks, an 80-minute documentary called <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/924719370">Climate: The Movie</a></em> has circulated online, causing quite a stir in the process. The film features something that has become vanishingly rare in today&#8217;s zeitgeist: scientists with otherwise impeccable pedigrees speaking openly and skeptically about human-induced climate change, presenting alternative viewpoints along with data to support them, and critiquing the cultural normalization of shutting down scientific debate. The movie is succinct and approachable, and we are surprised it hasn&#8217;t yet been scrubbed from the internet. Having snuck in a viewing before doing so is made illegal, we&#8217;d like to direct as much attention to the film as our audience will allow and contextualize its impact against recent political developments.</p>

Canonization involves first building a compelling case that a candidate is deserving of the position through three stages of acceptance: nomination as a &#8220;Servant of God&#8221; by a bishop with jurisdiction, promotion to &#8220;Venerable&#8221; and then, eventually, to beatification as &#8220;Blessed,&#8221; both through papal declaration. Advocates must then establish that two posthumous miracles are directly attributed to the nominee. Overseen by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Vatican, the process can take decades or even centuries.</p><p>Among the recent canonizations, the most famous occurred on September 4, 2016, when Pope Francis accepted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa">Mother Teresa</a> into the most holy of private clubs. The two miracles ascribed to Saint Teresa of Calcutta involved supernatural health interventions in India and Brazil, one of which invited quite a bit of controversy.

There is also a certain degree of fungibility between the hydrocarbon fuels, either because some machines are flexible in the fuels they can accept or because different fuel-specific machines compete to perform the same work.

Primary energy sources should, therefore, trade for similar prices, correcting for BTU content and shipping costs. They rarely do. When pricing deviates substantially from this baseline assumption, the market is trying to tell us something.</p><p>For example, during the energy crisis of 2021-2022, both landed liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal traded at substantial premiums to oil. Meanwhile, thermal coal traded for a premium to coking coal. Thermal coal had never traded for a premium to oil or coking coal before, at least as far back as our Bloomberg machine would let us plot. At that time, we speculated this was a signal that the market valued electricity more than chemicals and steel, and that Europe was headed for a period of stagflation. This turned out to be largely true.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2024 and the North American energy markets are currently experiencing perhaps the single greatest example of hydrocarbon arbitrage the world has ever seen, both in the size of the price differential and the huge volumes involved. We speak, of course, of the vast disparity between the price of domestic natural gas and that of oil. On an equivalent energy content basis, the price of a barrel of oil should be roughly six times that of a million BTUs of natural gas. Accounting for the complexity of handling natural gas, oil has historically oscillated between 10-20 times natural gas. As of the time of this writing, it stands at 45:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png" width="1456" height="766" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:766,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:564887,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa67535d1-de7f-45b0-96b3-6c8cdb2f5784_2424x1275.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In our view, geopolitical risk explains this incredible disparity. Despite relatively balanced physical markets, the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are pushing oil prices much higher than the rest of the primary energy complex. In meaningfully significant areas of the US, oil and gas are co-produced as complex mixtures. With oil trading where it is, the motivation to keep drilling is high, regardless of the price garnered for the unwanted gas byproduct. This is especially true in the Permian Basin, where spot prices for natural gas have been <em>negative</em> for much of the past month.</p><p>That which can&#8217;t go on forever usually doesn&#8217;t, and valuable hydrocarbons won&#8217;t trade for substantial discounts to their molecular peers indefinitely. Heat is heat, after all, and market forces will grind away at this staggering arbitrage until it is closed. Throughout North America, a quiet revolution is underway. Machines are being modified, processes reconfigured, and infrastructure developed to switch from expensive oil-based products to dirt-cheap gas. Let&#8217;s head to the shale patch and highlight a few interesting examples.</p>

Fresh off a successful campaign in which the family-led outfit mined more than 800 ounces of gold in the Yukon, the Hoffmans bet it all on the hope that rich deposits of the precious metal could be found in the small South American country. With a large assembly of expensive equipment in tow, the ragtag group set out to find their fortune.</p><p>It didn&#8217;t go so well. From one setback to another, the Hoffman&#8217;s adventure in Guyana devolved into disaster. After months of back-breaking work through unruly terrain and equipment failures, the group had only two ounces of gold and a small handful of diamonds to show for the effort, hardly enough to offset the operation&#8217;s significant expenses. Out of cash and with few prospects, the Hoffmans headed home in defeat. Guyana may be open for business to foreigners, but the mere presence of abundant natural resources is no guarantee of success.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png" width="836" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:836,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:798331,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e73aff-1717-4bec-860e-7840b39a9706_836x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A swing and a miss | Discovery Channel</figcaption></figure></div><p>Around the time the Hoffmans were beating their hasty retreat, a rather more sophisticated outfit was doing a little prospecting of its own. Having initiated an exploratory drilling program for black gold in 2008, a consortium led by ExxonMobil began to <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/locations/guyana/guyana-project-overview#DiscoveriesintheStabroekBlock">announce</a> a series of massive offshore oil discoveries in 2015. The news set off a rush of activity, with billions in foreign investments <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/120123-infographic-guyana-oil-output-drilling-fangtooth-production">pouring into the country</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>With more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources estimated so far offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil and partners Hess and China&#8217;s CNOOC have made over 30 discoveries in the Stabroek Block &#8211; and more are anticipated. First oil at a third project, Payara, began in November. Production is slated at two more sanctioned developments, Yellowtail in 2025 and Uaru in 2026, which is projected to bring Guyana&#8217;s total output to 800,000 boe/d.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>At the time of ExxonMobil&#8217;s seminal announcement, Guyana&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/GUY/guyana/gdp-gross-domestic-product">averaged</a> just $5,668 per capita, less than a tenth of that enjoyed by citizens of the US. With a population a shade higher than 800,000, the country&#8217;s insignificant energy footprint was grouped into the category of &#8220;Other&#8221; in the annual <em><a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review">Statistical Review of World Energy</a></em>. Since that time, Guyana&#8217;s GDP per capita has more than tripled and its economy is among the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-fastest-growing-economies-in-2024/">fastest growing</a> in the world. In a few short years, its citizens can expect to be as wealthy as their counterparts in the UK, a country that counted Guyana as a colony as recently as 1966.</p><p>In more balanced times, witnessing a comparatively impoverished country win the natural resources lottery would be a cause for celebration. Not so for the apostles of the Church of Carbon&#8482;, for whom Guyana&#8217;s newfound economic success is generating panic. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1773782655546618202">video</a> that went viral last week, the president of Guyana was confronted by a BBC reporter about the carbon footprint associated with all this winning.

Such incidents are <a href="https://www.jsheld.com/insights/articles/solar-farm-hail-damage-the-perfect-storm">far more common</a> than reported in traditional outlets, and the need to replace damaged equipment only drives further demand for Chinese-made components.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png" width="1280" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1288042,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32542c5b-e0ff-483a-bed0-39030c1b1d11_1280x720.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Hail and not-so-hearty | Fox News</figcaption></figure></div><p>With such lopsided relative attributes, one marvels at how most Western governments have come to direct so much of their taxpayers&#8217; money to solar while actively withdrawing from nuclear. The driving force: politics. Radical anti-nuclear activists have <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/nuclear-waste">infiltrated</a> Western regulatory bodies like the NRC where they successfully made nuclear capacity virtually impossible to build and challenging to operate, driving precious investment dollars out of the industry.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t always thus. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, France was able to swiftly and economically bring online <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france.aspx">60 GW of new nuclear capacity</a>&#8212;the equivalent of 75 Palisades reactors&#8212;and has enjoyed one of the cleanest electricity grids ever since. A similar story was observed in the Canadian province of <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/cheat-codes">Ontario</a>.

Perhaps recognizing the unworkability and unpopularity of the &#8220;renewables only&#8221; approach, President Joe Biden, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer have all thrown their political weight behind nuclear as part of their respective energy transition strategies, much to the horror of the extreme left of the current Democratic coalition. News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/michigan-palisades-nuclear-power-plant-reopen-federal-loan/">broke</a> last week of Whitmer&#8217;s decision to bring the Palisades site back to life (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>The federal government will provide a $1.5 billion loan to restart a nuclear power plant in Covert, Michigan, officials announced Wednesday</strong>. Holtec International acquired the 800-megawatt Palisades plant in 2022 with plans to dismantle it. But now the emphasis is on restarting it by late 2025, following support from the state of Michigan and the Biden administration.</em></p><p><em>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said it would be the first nuclear power plant to be reopened in the U.S. <strong>It still faces hurdles, including inspections, testing and the blessing of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, known as the NRC</strong>.</em></p><p><em>&#8216;Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly,&#8217; said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This news foreshadows a political civil war lurking on the nuclear front. While most commentators have noted that a Palisades restart would be a historic first in the US, our attention was immediately drawn to the need to obtain &#8220;<em>the blessing of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission</em>&#8221; before real progress could be realized. One would think the full support of a sitting US president and his Secretary of the Department of Energy would be sufficient to get the job done, but grizzled veterans of the nuclear industry can attest that this is anything but a given. Whether the NRC stands in the way of this amazing development and continues to be the gating factor stunting nuclear energy&#8217;s expansion is perhaps the most important question currently facing the US energy sector. Let&#8217;s gauge the odds of a true political breakthrough.</p>

In one camp sit those for whom their word is sacrosanct. Between members of this group, much business gets done with little more than a handshake, a commitment to deliver on promises, and an implicit acknowledgement that value is best shared among the partners that took the risk to co-create it. In the other camp sit those for whom their word is effectively meaningless. Loopholes are sought and exploited to gain advantage over their counterparties, contracts are merely opening salvos of future court cases, and paying for hardcore litigators is seen as an investment rather than an expense.</p><p>In a properly functioning society, business ethics would be highly prized and those who abuse others in this way would be shunned from the system. If few can be trusted, social order is tough to come by, let alone economic prosperity. For as much as this publication enjoys taking the occasional jab at Warren Buffett, few can deny that Mr. Aw-Shucks is a man of his word. True to one of Buffett&#8217;s many famous quips, &#8220;<em>You can&#8217;t make a good deal with a bad person,&#8221;</em> we are unaware of a single instance in which he wavered from a firm commitment, even during the great financial crisis of 2008. If Buffett strikes a deal, his word is &#8220;money good.&#8221; Alas, he is a member of an ever-shrinking minority.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg" width="1024" height="683" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:683,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:115585,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a55e633-7b9e-47af-b31e-e0a2f5307f6e_1024x683.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Mr. Aw-Shucks | Getty</figcaption></figure></div><p>Integrity in business is especially critical for the success of long-term, capital-intense projects that require complex partnerships and significant outside financing. In such circumstances, it has become standard practice for developers to share risks with their future customers, often by entering into long-term supply contracts with well-articulated pricing mechanisms. These formal commitments&#8212;typically triggered once the project is commissioned&#8212;are then used to support the acquisition of bank financing, thus paving the way for investment in projects that are critical for the long-term success of the global economy.</p><p>An analysis of the economic incentives involved when parties enter long-term supply contracts of this nature is relatively straightforward. In exchange for guaranteeing a minimum return to the developers&#8212;presumably, one that comfortably exceeds their cost of capital for the project&#8212;customers get surety of supply at known prices. If market prices fall below those specified in the agreement, the developer benefits from the ability to charge what had previously been agreed to. If prices go the other way, developers lose out on outsized gains and profits accrue to the customers. The entire point is to specifically share risks and rewards in this way. Integrated over time and across many such deals, wins and losses should roughly equalize.</p><p>With this nuance of heavy industry properly contextualized, we turn now to perhaps one of the most audacious commercial disputes in recent history. Venture Global, an upstart player in the US liquefied natural gas (LNG) market and builder of the massive LNG export facility at Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana, is locked in a bitter dispute with the very customers who helped facilitate that project&#8217;s financing. We turn to an <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/061223-venture-global-defends-extended-calcasieu-pass-commissioning-as-dispute-with-customers-escalates">article</a> in <em>S&amp;P Global </em>from last June for some background (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Venture Global pushed back against criticism from some foundation customers of Calcasieu Pass in the <strong>escalating dispute over the operator's wait to declare the LNG export facility ready for commercial service</strong>, saying its long-term contracts showed it had always planned to begin shipments &#8216;far in advance&#8217; of completing the terminal.

According to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_poe2_dcu_YCCPL-Z00_a.htm">data</a> from the US Department of Energy, LNG exports from Calcasieu Pass averaged more than 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) for the entirety of 2023&#8212;volumes that are roughly equivalent to its nameplate capacity&#8212;and yet the company refuses to formally acknowledge that the facility is &#8220;commissioned.&#8221; In doing so, it appears to have reneged on at least the spirit of its contractual obligations and has profited from its ability to take advantage of historically high spot market prices for natural gas to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. This has come at the expense of the parties that made their business possible in the first place.</p><p>On what basis does the company make this stance? How will this situation be resolved, and what are the potential long-term impacts on the energy sector? Let&#8217;s wade into the dispute and learn more.</p>

Long before the courts effectively <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/10/we-did-not-approve-or-endorse-bitcoin-gary-genslers-begrudging-etf-statement/">ordered</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve plain vanilla Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Saylor made his own by converting his fledgling software company into what amounts to a heavily leveraged ETF that holds Bitcoin. With the recent approval of several new Bitcoin ETF vehicles, the flow of money into the sector has been truly astronomical, sending the coin higher and&#8212;for now, at least&#8212;making a mockery of our <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/a-drunken-saylor">prior</a> <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/dollars-ex-machina">warnings</a> that Saylor would suffer from his <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/double-down">recklessness</a>. (We had yet to appreciate the pumpamentals.)</p><p>In the two years since we last wrote about Saylor and MicroStrategy, the price of Bitcoin collapsed by half before more than quadrupling off the lows on the heels of the new influx of fiat. All along the journey&#8212;no matter the price or the risk&#8212;Saylor has been taking on debt, <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/experience/microstrategy-750-million-market-offering-december-2023">selling stock</a>, and doing everything in his power to raise cash, buy more Bitcoin, and pump its prospects. History is written by the winners, and few could deny Saylor has been riding high lately. &nbsp;The MicroStrategy story is among the most intriguing in the current book of market narratives, one that may be instructive beyond the superficial scoreboard of gains and losses for the stock or even the price of Bitcoin itself. Let&#8217;s explore why.</p>

The avalanche of money pouring into the AI sector will inevitably create a wave of fresh demand for power, something Cembalest noted in his essay (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>An important caveat: our Electravision scenario assumes that total US energy needs will not change much over the next two decades. Unchanged US energy demand is consistent with the last couple of decades; the energy needs of a growing US population have been offset by improving energy efficiency. <strong>However, the rise of AI might change that.</strong> One illustrative example: the PJM (mid-Atlantic) region has made sharp increases to projections of future power demand.</em></p><p><em><strong>These increases are entirely due to an increase in data centers which serve advanced computing/AI needs</strong>. Constellation Energy estimates that the AI revolution could require more power in the US than the future electric vehicle fleet. If that&#8217;s the case, the productivity benefits from AI better be large enough to offset the increase power load. Bottom line: <strong>the rise of AI could make the journey to Electravision longer, harder and most costly</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In <em><a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/fission-chips">Fission Chips</a></em>, a piece published last November, we speculated that the need to power AI might be the issue that fuels a nuclear renaissance. Society has always rearranged itself to grow its computing power exponentially, and nuclear is the obvious (and, for all practical purposes, the only) answer to keeping us on that path. We concluded that &#8220;<em>[t]he advance of AI, for better or worse, may be the force that finally lifts nuclear from the fallacy of its bad reputation in the US. Kurzweil&#8217;s vision requires vastly more nuclear power to be realized, and betting against The Singularity has been a losing trade for decades.</em>&#8221;</p><p>Pro-nuclear advocates welcomed an historic announcement last week when Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world&#8217;s largest operator of data centers, made a <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/05/amazon-just-bought-a-100-nuclear-powered-data-center/">decisive move</a> that all but validated the inevitable:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>One of the US&#8217;s largest nuclear power plants will directly power cloud service provider Amazon Web Services&#8217; new data center. Power provider Talen Energy sold its data center campus, Cumulus Data Assets, to Amazon Web Services for $650 million. Amazon will develop an up to 960-megawatt (MW) data center at the Salem Township site in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.</em></p><p><em><strong>The 1,200-acre campus is directly powered by an adjacent 2.5 gigawatt (GW) nuclear power station also owned by Talen Energy</strong>.</em></p><p><em>The 1,075-acre Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is the sixth-largest nuclear power plant in the US. It&#8217;s been online since 1983 and produces 63 million kilowatt hours per day. The plant has two General Electric boiling water reactors within a Mark II containment building that are licensed through 2042 and 2044.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3414361,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93afe38d-e22f-4c55-b4a5-e6dbd0227d54_1920x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A marriage made in isotopes | Talen/Cumulus</figcaption></figure></div><p>The AWS news comes on the heels of other notable developments pointing to a logical reunification of physics and policy. The <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/coulda-woulda-shoulda-doombergs-readout">global stocktake</a> from the most recent United Nations climate change summit acknowledged, for the first time, that nuclear is an essential and clean contributor to decarbonization efforts. At the same meeting, the Biden administration led a coalition of more than 20 countries that collectively <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key">committed</a> to tripling their nuclear capacity by 2050.

With front-month contracts recently trading for as low as $1.55 per million BTUs (mmBTUs)&#8212;an energy equivalent price of less than $10 per barrel of oil&#8212;and production surging into an unusually warm winter, the market was screaming for voluntary reductions. On Monday, the largest producer of natural gas in the US became the latest to yield, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eqt-announces-strategic-production-curtailment-302077913.html">announcing</a> a significant pullback from its near-term production plans:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) ("EQT" or the "Company") today announced it made the strategic decision to curtail approximately 1 Bcf per day of gross production beginning in late February in response to the current low natural gas price environment resulting from warm winter weather and consequent elevated storage inventories. The Company expects to maintain this curtailment through the month of March and will reassess market conditions thereafter. Curtailments are expected to total approximately 30 to 40 Bcf of net production during the first quarter.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Price action responded modestly favorably to the news, which came on the heels of a <a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/chesapeake-announces-major-natural-gas-production-cuts-in-response-to-oversupplied-market/">similar move</a> by Chesapeake Energy and others in the sector, posing the question as to whether the bottom is now in for one of the world&#8217;s largest and cheapest sources of hydrocarbon fuels:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png" width="1456" height="730" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:730,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:491726,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd278d17f-08ea-4a38-ab07-1b1ddab366bd_2370x1189.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The production side response to the glut is but one factor in considering how the US natural gas market might correct itself.

Per an analysis published by <em>RBN News</em> in January titled &#8220;<em><a href="https://rbnenergy.com/down-in-mexico-new-pipelines-and-power-plants-spur-ever-higher-natural-gas-exports-to-mexico">Down in Mexico</a></em>,&#8221; there is capacity for further growth (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>With all the talk about U.S. LNG exports and plans for more LNG export capacity, it can be easy to forget that more than 6 Bcf/d of U.S. natural gas &#8212; mostly from the Permian and the Eagle Ford &#8212; is being piped to Mexico. <strong>That&#8217;s more than 3X the volumes that were being piped south of the border 10 years ago</strong>, a tripling made possible by the buildout of new pipelines from the Agua Dulce and Waha hubs to the Rio Grande and, from there, new pipes within Mexico. And where is all that gas headed? Mostly to new gas-fired power plants and industrial facilities &#8212; a handful of new LNG export terminals being planned on that side of the border will only add to the demand&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Taken together, <strong>these three [pipeline] corridors</strong> <strong>have the capacity to pipe more than 11 Bcf/d across the U.S./Mexico border</strong>. Given that U.S. gas exports to Mexico averaged 6.2 Bcf/d in the first 10 months of 2023 &#8212; and peaked at about 7 Bcf/d in August &#8212; there is clearly plenty of room for growth as Mexican gas demand increases and the pipelines transporting gas to those new demand centers come online.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Mexico serves as a prime example of the <em>Doomberg</em> axiom that energy plays the central role when analyzing an economy. Because of its privileged position within NAFTA, the country has been simultaneously able to gorge on cheap primary energy from the US <em>and</em> directly serve the gigantic US market with the output of its factories. Mix in ready access to affordable labor aided by the urgent rush to friend-shore critical supply chains and the result is an underreported economic boomlet, one that has resulted in solid growth, a strengthening currency, and robust foreign direct investment. These developments have more than overcome Mexico&#8217;s well-known domestic challenges. Let&#8217;s take a look at the numbers.</p>

Peter</p><p>A few weeks ago, Charlie Angus took to the floor of the Canadian Parliament to propose <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-372/first-reading">Bill C-372</a>, otherwise known as the <em>Fossil Fuels Advertising Act</em>. Angus is a quintessential member of the Canadian political left and a backbencher in the New Democratic Party (NDP), the junior partner in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/reality-bites">minority government</a>. As a private member&#8217;s bill&#8212;one that is not proposed by a minister nor formally backed by the full weight of the government&#8217;s machinery&#8212;Bill C-372 stands virtually no chance of becoming law. Angus&#8217; gambit nonetheless served its primary purpose, creating a burst of global headlines due to its sheer audacity. Here&#8217;s how Canada&#8217;s <em>National Post</em> <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/ndp-bill-jail-terms-fossil-fuels">covered</a> the story (emphasis added throughout):</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;<em>Today, I am proud to rise and introduce a bill that would make illegal false advertising by the oil and gas industry,&#8217; Angus announced in the House of Commons. He added that the oil and gas sector was trafficking in &#8216;disinformation&#8217; and &#8216;killing people.&#8217; Angus also twice framed his bill as the dawn of the industry&#8217;s &#8216;big tobacco moment&#8217; &#8212; an apparent reference to Canada&#8217;s blanket federal ban on tobacco advertising.</em></p><p><em>But C-372 goes well beyond merely banning advertising by oil and gas companies... <strong>as written, the act would technically apply to any Canadian who is found to be speaking well of the oil industry, or of oil generally</strong>.</em></p><p><em>&#8216;It is prohibited for a person to promote a fossil fuel, a fossil fuel-related brand element or the production of a fossil fuel,&#8217; reads the act. <strong>Violate this as a regular citizen, and the act prescribes summary conviction and a fine of up to $500,000</strong>. Violate it as an oil company, and the punishment could be as strict as two years in jail or a fine of $1,000,000</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:370159,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a7a2654-a187-4342-a954-05a1cc388d12_840x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Do-gooder | Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press</figcaption></figure></div><p>It would be easy to dismiss Angus as just another wingnut politician pushing forward a crazy concept that few support.

Never mind that our subscribers have proactively chosen to hear our views, routinely critique what we write (both in the comments section and directly via email), and are free-thinking people capable of reading things they might disagree with while simultaneously coming to their own conclusions&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Despite our best efforts to express authentically held views in a civil manner and to back those views with data, we suspect it won&#8217;t be long. The creeping incrementalism of the do-gooders who have empowered themselves to adjudicate what information is suitable for public consumption will mean ever more topics are considered off-limits. <strong>Soon, critiquing society&#8217;s response to climate change will be labeled another form of climate denialism, and efforts to de-platform those expressing such views will accelerate</strong>.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Color us not-so-surprised when we <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/youtube-s-climate-denial-problem-is-growing-and-evolving">read this</a> truly amazing article in <em>Bloomberg </em>earlier this year:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The nature of climate misinformation on Google-owned YouTube is evolving, according to a new report. Videos espousing climate denial are declining across nearly 100 YouTube channels, while videos attacking solutions such as wind and solar are proliferating.</em></p><p><em>The nonprofit <strong>Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</strong> <strong>identified 96 YouTube channels that frequently disseminate what it described as misleading climate talking points&#8230;</strong></em></p><p><em>The researchers<strong> </strong>found<strong> examples of videos claiming that people&#8217;s standard of living will decrease with a transition away from fossil fuels; that renewable projects require more land than fossil fuels; and that energy-efficiency policies don&#8217;t actually reduce energy use</strong>. The researchers also identified sub-claims within each category and many videos included multiple types of denial claims.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Set aside the fact that the &#8220;examples&#8221; of the three alleged disinformation positions &#8220;found&#8221; by &#8220;the researchers&#8221; and breathlessly reported on in one of the world&#8217;s premier business periodicals are all plainly true and easily proven as such. Ignore the fact that the sole, erstwhile reporter who occupies the byline of this article labels wind and solar as accepted &#8220;solutions&#8221; to climate change without giving it a second thought, thereby transposing what was meant to parade as a piece of straight reporting into one that might find a better home in the <em>Opinion</em> section. The report itself rails against &#8220;New Denial,&#8221; an invented term referring to <em>&#8220;rhetoric seeking to undermine confidence in solutions to climate change.&#8221;</em> What matters here is the intentional attempt to normalize the labeling of views held by those critical of energy policy decisions as &#8220;digital hate,&#8221; a phrase that conjures all manner of genuinely deplorable activity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png" width="1456" height="939" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:939,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:935934,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfeae065-6941-4185-a481-277d9c8e7fe7_2210x1426.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Official Newspeak of New Denial | CCDH</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the 96 YouTube channels targeted by the CCDH report are many respected institutions, a variety of controversial personalities, and a small handful of podcasts that have hosted Doomberg on numerous occasions.

Our <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/about">commitment</a> to our subscribers is to write 6-8 articles a month, and although we do not publish to a fixed schedule, we are proud to have delivered on this commitment, averaging one article roughly every 4.2 days. Given the number of predictions, opinions, and statements of fact embedded within that body of work, it is inevitable we will nail some calls while flubbing others. We don&#8217;t shy away from expressing a view, even a bold one, so long as we can show our homework.</p><p>As analysts with a mindset of continuous improvement, we have found it particularly useful to occasionally take a beat, look back on what we have published, and grade ourselves. It has been five months since we <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/monday-morning-in-the-coop">last</a> aired our internal laundry &#8211; let&#8217;s string up the clothesline and see how we&#8217;ve done recently.</p><h4><strong>Cogent Analysis</strong></h4><p>We begin with a mea culpa. In &#8220;<a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/cogent-analysis">Cogent Analysis</a>,&#8221; we linked the collapse in front-month natural gas contract prices directly to President Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-pauses-approval-new-lng-export-projects-win-climate-activists-2024-01-26/">decision</a> to halt export approvals for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. We attributed sentiment&#8212;and the market&#8217;s signal to producers that it was time to rein in supply&#8212;with the violently negative price action observed immediately after Biden&#8217;s announcement. A few of our subscribers with expertise trading such contracts objected to that assertion, arguing that unusually warm weather explained more of the variance. Although Biden&#8217;s move was not helpful, its impact could better be measured by observing changes in the out-months of the futures curve, which had only moved down roughly 10% on the news (versus 25% or more on the short end). After pondering the issue further, we have concluded that they are more right than we were and felt it important to say so publicly.</p><p>We believe mistakes such as these should be rare, admitted to, corrected, and learned from. Having discharged the first three of those steps, we now share what we&#8217;ve gleaned in the fourth. A common approach to measuring the impact of weather on the short-term demand for natural gas is to inspect heating degree-day data, a metric calculated by <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/degree-days.php">comparing</a> &#8220;<em>the mean (the average of the high and low) outdoor temperatures recorded for a location to a standard temperature, usually 65&#176; Fahrenheit (F) in the United States.</em>&#8221; The seasonality chart for aggregate US heating degree-days is indeed striking&#8212;visual testimony to how unusually warm this winter has been. Rumors of Biden&#8217;s LNG announcement coincided with the sharp turn in weather observed after January&#8217;s record cold spell.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png" width="1456" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1526314,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35677cff-0834-4004-b1dd-823d31db9f7d_2856x1506.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Liquefied Natural Glut</strong></h4><p>For much of November, we embarked on a detailed analysis of the global natural gas market in preparation for that month&#8217;s <em><a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/simple-molecule-complicated-markets">Doom Zoom</a></em> presentation to our <em>Pro</em> tier members. Marinating in the data, we saw clearly that the energy crisis of 2021-2022 led to a substantial wave of investment in both the exploitation of existing natural gas reserves and the construction of LNG terminals around the world. With many of these investments set to come online soon, the prospect of an imminent glut in the market could not be discounted. Frankly, our conclusion came as a bit of a surprise internally.</p><p>We next began to ponder the impact of such a development on other primary energy sources, especially coal and oil. We followed up our <em>Pro</em> tier presentation with a full article in early December, &#8220;<a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/liquefied-natural-glut-resend">Liquefied Natural Glut</a>,&#8221; in which we signaled our belief that the world was entering a period of excess energy. We closed the article rather explicitly:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>When energy is short, the world struggles to grow, countries rich in commodities hold the upper hand, and their currencies appreciate accordingly. In periods of excess energy, economic growth is easier to be had and the countries that add value to energy via downstream manufacturing reign supreme. Like the end of the drought in southern China, the avalanche of new natural gas supply coming online in the years ahead will usher in a period of significant excess.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>To drive home the basis for our change in outlook and its importance to our evolving framework, we next sent a free copy of that November <em>Doom Zoom</em> session to all paying subscribers in advance of the holidays. We believed the world had changed, and we wanted as many of you to know about it as possible. Price action in the intervening months seems to confirm this call, as the futures curve for the Dutch TTF contract has continued to collapse since November. Even Biden&#8217;s LNG export approval pause failed to stem the bleeding. The world has flipped from short to long primary energy&#8212;at least for the time being.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png" width="1456" height="1019" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1019,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:516179,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5aaae162-eed8-4acf-a251-a422a172acbe_1855x1298.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Minority Report</strong></h4><p>Although we normally eschew politics in these pages, understanding how the political winds are blowing is a key input into the evolution of energy markets. On the rare occasion that we cover politics directly, our goal is to do so through an ideological lens, not a partisan one. Four months ago, we <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/minority-report">chronicled</a> the backstory surrounding the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#8212;his predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, had committed to support his speakership in the &#8220;unlikely event&#8221; that it came under attack, and her failure to do so at a critical moment was pivotal to his ultimate downfall. We pondered whether the Democrats might come to regret McCarthy&#8217;s departure, especially as it pertained to securing further funding for the war in Ukraine. Here is a key passage from that piece:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Setting aside the folly of taunting political opponents you&#8217;ll soon need to collaborate with, whether Biden&#8217;s gambit even succeeds is uncertain. The latest <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/biden-plans-bundle-ukraine-taiwan-222240565.html">trial balloon</a> indicates the White House may bundle &#8216;money for Ukraine, Taiwan, and U.S. border security along with financial assistance for Israel.&#8217; The expanding pool of concessions being considered to get conservatives back onboard does not seem a projection of political strength, and the situation remains deeply fluid. Much depends on how quickly Republicans can settle on a new speaker (assuming they ever do), which bill gains the early momentum, and how strongly conservatives dig in on their opposition to Ukraine&#8230;</em></p><p><em>As the spiral of global conflict begins to resemble World War III, sharp political divisions within the US will have real consequences. Petty political partisanship, like that witnessed in the McCarthy toppling, threatens the West&#8217;s ability to devise a united strategy, let alone a coherent one. One can&#8217;t help but fear the world will be worse for it.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg" width="1280" height="853" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/df39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:853,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:120924,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf39baf4-1eb3-43e7-8b14-09f6c5c5e3f4_1280x853.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sorry, pal | Getty</figcaption></figure></div><p>Events have since unfolded in a manner that fully validates our concerns. McCarthy&#8217;s replacement has indeed taken a much harder line, funding for Ukraine is still stuck in political limbo, and Russia has seized significant momentum on the battlefield.&nbsp; The consequences of a possible total defeat of Ukraine&#8212;and by extension, the NATO alliance&#8212;have yet to be openly pondered by many in the Western media. We respectfully suggest such an outcome is far more likely than the public is being led to believe. The impact on energy markets would be profound, and we intend to keep a close eye on the situation.</p><h4><strong>Whack-A-Mole</strong></h4><p>The topic we are least happy to be most right about is the sheer idiocy of the West&#8217;s sanctions strategy against Russia. That it would not only fail but backfire has been a key theme of ours from nearly the moment the sanctions were unveiled in early 2022. In November, we dedicated a third piece to the topic, &#8220;<a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/whack-a-mole">Whack-A-Mole</a>,&#8221; and wrote the following:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>As the second anniversary of the war in Ukraine approaches, and with the abject failure of the West&#8217;s sanctions to dent Putin&#8217;s revenue vividly apparent, have our leaders learned anything? Sadly, nothing in their behavior would indicate so.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, things have only gone from dumb to dumber since then. Last week, both the US and Europe announced additional sanctions against scores of new entities, including&#8212;for the first time&#8212;individuals and companies in China and India. Here&#8217;s how the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7ef97342-48fa-4969-b3ee-bc7419b69e65">covered</a> the EU sanctions announcement:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>The EU has agreed a [sic] new package of sanctions against Russia that for the first time targets Chinese and Indian companies accused of supporting Moscow&#8217;s war effort.</em></p><p><em>The measures, which will be the 13th package of sanctions imposed by Brussels in response to Russia&#8217;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, target close to 200 individuals and entities but stop short of any sweeping economic action targeting crucial industrial sectors.</em></p><p><em>&#8216;We must keep degrading [Vladimir] Putin&#8217;s war machine&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;[and] keep the pressure high on the Kremlin,&#8217; European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in response to the sanctions agreement on Wednesday, adding that the measures also aimed to target &#8216;Russia&#8217;s access to drones.&#8217;</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg" width="840" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:840,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61965,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e324857-a9a5-44a3-88ab-eaa5fd62b199_840x600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We hate to break it to von der Leyen, but these sanctions are about as likely to degrade Putin&#8217;s war machine as Xi Jinping is to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-divide-rule-eu-france-unity-ursula-von-der-leyen-emmanuel-macron-xi-jinping/">treat you like a peer</a>. That no member within the entourage of Western leadership circles has the faintest idea how self-destructive their attempts to sanction Russia are&#8212;and will continue to be&#8212;is one of the great mysteries of our time.</p><h4><strong>Gold in Resolution</strong></h4><p>Finally, last month we wrote on the <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/gold-in-resolution">subject of gold</a>, speculating that 2024 could resolve two pressing issues: the metal&#8217;s future role in global trade as a neutral reserve asset, and whether its paper price was artificially suppressed in Western markets. On the first subject, we noted that the US and UK were pressing to seize some $300 billion of Russian foreign reserves, a move fraught with dangerous legal and geopolitical consequences. Analysts had pegged February 24, 2024, the second anniversary of the war between Russia and Ukraine, as the day it would likely occur. Well, the day has come and gone and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-24/ukraine-bankers-call-for-tighter-laws-over-seized-russian-assets">calmer heads</a> have prevailed, at least for now:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>International banks have warned the UK government that it must establish legal principles before it presses the button on the seizure of billions of pounds of Russian assets, otherwise it risks potential shocks to the global financial system and exposing institutions to legal action.</em></p><p><em>Sweeping international sanctions, imposed after Moscow&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, froze an array of assets including about $300 billion owned by the Russian central bank. Now, on the second anniversary of the invasion, a global campaign by politicians and activists is demanding that the assets be seized and the proceeds sent to Kyiv.</em></p><p><em>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his UK counterpart David Cameron are among those who have called for seizures, while political leaders in the European Union have been more cautious. About two-thirds of the Russian central bank&#8217;s $300 billion is stuck in the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear.</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>On the question of paper-market suppression, we noted that premium prices in Shanghai opened an arbitrage opportunity that would inevitably result in physical gold leaving vaults in New York and London to capture premium in the East. According to a Bloomberg index that tracks this premium, it has stubbornly persisted in the past month and might explain why gold has been consistently bid above $2,000 an ounce. We find this chart to be among the most interesting on our terminal, one we check multiple times a week.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png" width="1456" height="764" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:764,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:624369,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ef5887-6908-4728-80d0-07bfd43b964d_2392x1255.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h4><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h4><p>We began this article with an admission of a mistake. Any analyst who publishes regularly in the finance and energy worlds will inevitably miss something, make a prediction that does not pan out, or inadvertently make a material misstatement. Nobody bats a thousand, certainly not us. Our goal is to still be publishing under the <em>Doomberg</em> masthead a decade from now (or more!), and a healthy dose of self-reflection makes for a solid investment in our sustainability as a team. We have much to cover in the months ahead and can&#8217;t wait to get at it!</p><p><em><strong>&#8220;</strong></em>&#9825; <em><strong>Like&#8221; this piece unless your perfect or something.</strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg" width="836" height="509" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:509,&quot;width&quot;:836,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:165513,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5511a1d2-49d6-4cf3-b27e-bae94b7a1e8c_836x509.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
