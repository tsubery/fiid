        \  <media:description>It's been one of the most absurd weeks in the world
        of finance and economics since I don't know when.  A tiny bank was declared
        too big to fail.  Apple stock surged on terrible earnings. The Fed talked
        like a Hawk and walked like Dove. Yellen is paying off low interest debt with
        high interest debt. The Japanese currency is imploding. And the financial
        press is wearing a mask of euphoria like some kind of demented murderous street
        mime from Rob Zombie flick.\n\nSupport the Channel on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/NobodySpecialFinance\nSupport

        \  <media:description>Amazon reported strong earnings yesterday that showed
        remarkable growth in AWS which includes their cloud and AI business but those
        results have been offset by lighter than expected guidance for the current
        quarter leading to a muted reaction in the stock.  Elsewhere AI darlings AMD
        and SMCI are both selling off this morning following earnings that failed
        to meet the increasingly softy expectations for anything pertaining to Artificial
        Intelligence.  Now the market pins it's hopes on the Federal Reserve and Jerome
        Powell who will speak later today following the conclusion of the FOMC meeting.\n\nSupport

        expectations of 1.0% and a prior increase of 0.9% last quarter.  This is yet
        another sign that inflation has not been defeated and a second wave could
        be forming.  Meanwhile the US treasury announced it borrowing plans yesterday
        and Secretary Yellen intends to borrow approximately 20% more than the market
        was expecting.\n\nSupport the Channel on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/NobodySpecialFinance\nSupport

        \  <media:description>Republic First Bank has failed. The bank's failure itself
        is a relatively unimportant story.  It's a small bank that failed for reasons
        we already knew about.  But the government's response to this non-event is
        outright terrifying!\n\nLink to my video about bank bail-ins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKMmSbhvIpU\n\nSupport

        earnings this week.  The company reporting the best earnings was crushed.
        The company reporting the the worst earnings surged. Two companies posted
        lackluster guidance, but only one of them was punished for it while the other
        wasn't.  Two companies used empty rhetoric about AI, one was punished, one
        was rewarded.  Economic growth was cut in half while inflation is on the rise
        and the market is up for the week.  Just WTF is going on with the Mag 7 and

        last year's labor disputes, wages are sharply higher.  The company has tried
        to offset this decline with layoffs.  Elsewhere General Motors (GM) reported
        a big jump in profits driven entirely by higher prices for vehicles.\n\nSupport

        \  <media:description>The AI Mania has fizzled out and semiconductor stocks
        have just had their worst week since January of 2022.  High flying AI names
        such as Nvidia, Supermicro, and ARM Holdings are all down double digits.  Is
        this the bursting of the AI bubble or just another dip that'll get bought
        up by people who have no clue what their buying?\n\nSupport the Channel on

        \  <media:description>Israel blew up a patch of dirt in Iran last night in
        a widely telegraphed, scripted move that achieved no tactical purpose and
        surprised nobody. Initial spikes in oil and precious metals quickly reversed
        as traders begin to realize the whole thing was an act for the cameras.  Meanwhile
        earnings continue to roll in with Netflix reporting stellar numbers, but the
        stock is dumping after the company announced a change to the way they'll report
        the data going forward.\n\nSupport the Channel on Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/NobodySpecialFinance\nSupport
